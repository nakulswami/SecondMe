## Our Vision

Companies like OpenAI built "Super AI" that threatens human independence. We crave individuality: AI that amplifies, not erases, you.

We’re challenging that with "**Second Me**": an open-source prototype where you craft your own **AI self**—a new AI species that preserves you, delivers your context, and defends your interests.

It’s **locally trained and hosted**—your data, your control—yet **globally connected**, scaling your intelligence across an AI network. Beyond that, it’s your AI identity interface—a bold standard linking your AI to the world, sparks collaboration among AI selves, and builds tomorrow’s truly native AI apps.

Join us. Tech enthusiasts, AI pros, domain experts—Second Me is your launchpad to extend your mind into the digital horizon.

## Key Features

### **Train Your AI Self** with AI-Native Memory ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08102))
Start training your Second Me today with your own memories! Using Hierarchical Memory Modeling (HMM) and the Me-Alignment Algorithm, your AI self captures your identity, understands your context, and reflects you authentically.

</p>


### **Scale Your Intelligence** on the Second Me Network
Launch your AI self from your laptop onto our decentralized network—anyone or any app can connect with your permission, sharing your context as your digital identity.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS operating system
- Git installed
- Homebrew (recommended for system dependencies)
- Xcode Command Line Tools (for using make commands)

#### Installing Xcode Command Line Tools
If you haven't installed Xcode Command Line Tools yet, you can install them by running:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

After installation, you may need to accept the license agreement:
```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git
cd Second-Me
```

2. Set up the environment

Using make (requires Xcode Command Line Tools):
```bash
make setup
```

Alternatively, you can use the setup script directly:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This command will automatically:
- Install all required system dependencies
- Set up Python environment
- Build llama.cpp
- Set up frontend environment

3. Start the service

Using make:
```bash
make start
```

Alternatively, use the script directly:
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

4. Access the service
Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

5. For help and more commands

Using make:
```bash
make help
```

## Acknowledgements

This work leverages the power of the open source community. 

For data synthesis, we utilized [GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag) from Microsoft.

For model deployment, we utilized [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), which provides efficient inference capabilities.

Our base models primarily come from the [Qwen2.5](https://huggingface.co/Qwen) series.

We also want to extend our sincere gratitude to all users who have experienced Second Me. We recognize that there is significant room for optimization throughout the entire pipeline, and we are fully committed to iterative improvements to ensure everyone can enjoy the best possible experience locally.
